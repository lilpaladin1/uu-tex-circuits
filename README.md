# UU-Tex Circuit Patch
---
This is a patch for [UU-Tex](https://github.com/jimbno/UU-Tex) that changes the scaling of each circuit to make it so that the citcuit gets larger as it goes up in price instead of how it was previously.

All credit goes to Jimbno for creating the original sprites and for giving me the source files so that I can make this patch.
